# BrainRot-Research-Paper
This research project analyzed the concept of "brain rot," a term used to describe cognitive decline due to excessive screen time and digital overstimulation, particularly in Gen Z. We conducted a university-wide survey and integrated data from a Kaggle dataset on phone addiction to examine behavioral patterns, app usage, and mental fatigue. The project involved data visualization, critical analysis of digital habits, and interpretation of the psychological effects of overconsumption of social media and entertainment apps. The study concluded with actionable insights and recommendations for digital wellness.
